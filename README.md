<p>My Name is Peyton Ward-Raposo Im 16 years old I was born on the date Oct 18 2007 and One of my past times when im not at school I like to read and i love speading time hanging out with my family and the last thing that i like doing after school is playing video games with my friends because I just really enjoy playing with my best friends and brings me great joy to hangout with my best friends. My goal for the future is trying to get really good at coding because i never really got to code as well as others because the schools that i went to did'n't get not as much as i wanting to by now i have a chance to try and give this thing a shot plus i want to know more about coding and i think this should be a fun thing to do. peyton.ward-raposo@student.tdsb.on.ca
